# Vanguard-Stock-API

This is an API that uses a Yahoo Finance API to fetch market prices for any stock. By inputting a valid stock symbol (GME, AMC, AAPL), the program will 
fetch the stock's current price and save it to a MongoDB Database.

It also comes with commented descriptions and unit tests to ensure that the program is working smoothly.
